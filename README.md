## What is Voma?

At a high level we're trying to achieve the following:

1. Facilitate a smooth process from attending onboarding night to setting up a 1x1 with a project lead
2. Better identify and develop our volunteer's skillsets - where do our skills currently align and where do we want them to go?
3. Integrate with our existing tools (Meetup, Slack, Trello, etc.)
4. Better visualize the scope of our members through skill dashboards and other visualizations
5. Automate whenever possible to reduce bottlenecks in onboarding

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Tech Stack

React<br />
Node / Express<br />
PostgreSQL

### Planned Integrations

Slack<br />

Trello

### Scope of MVP

1. New Member completes onboarding form (modeled after current Google Form)
2. System generates user profile based on input
3. Project Leads review new volunteers and set up 1x1s / assign to projects
